                <p>Creating a tailored presentation for a freelancer which would also support her professional services, facilitate her work with clients and help get new ones.</p>

                <h4>collaboration</h4>
                <p>Following my previous experience,<br> I have asked talented designer <a href="https://www.behance.net/martinnovotny93?tracking_source=search%7Cmartin%20novotny">Martin Novotny</a> to work with me on the UI/UX and graphic assets for this project.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>challenge</h4>
                <p>There were four main challenges we had to face:  How to stand out from competitors. How to create a quality, trustworthy product despite the reputation this 
                    field has in the public opinion of Czech Republic. 
                    To create a product supporting Helena’s work that helps build respect and gives authenticity to her services which will also serve as a standard tool for daily use. 
                    And finally create a channel for acquisition of new clients.

            <div class="cs_text">
                <h4>solution</h4>
                <p>With close cooperation with Helena, we created unique content focused on clients needs which would not be found anywhere else. (For example: In the mortgage section - 
                mortgage timeline or 3 steps to get mortgage) The results were great. It helped us simplify work with clients and build trustworthy relationships which was one of our main goals.</p>

                <h4>process</h4>
                <p>After researching competitors and a deep analysis of Helena’s business, we have agreed to build the website with emphasis on Helena's many years of experience. We put together unique 
                guidelines for clients which would be found only on her website. During the design phase we came with the idea of a beautifully illustrated avatar that will represent Helena 
                throughout the entire website. Also the illustrations, icons and functional interactive elements were made exclusively for this project.</p>
