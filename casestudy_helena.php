                <p>To create tailored presentation for freelancer which would also support her professional services, facilitate her work with clients and help to get new ones.</p>

                <h4>collaboration</h4>
                <p>Regarding our previous experience I have asked tallented designer Martin Novotny to work with me on UI/UX and graphic assets for this project.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>challenge</h4>
                <p>There were four main challenges we had to face. How to stand out between competition. How to create a quality product despite the reputation this
                     field has in public opinion in the Czech Republic. To create a product supporting Helena’s work, help build respect and authority in her 
                     services and will serve as a standard tool for daily use. And finally create a channel for aquisition of new clients.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/helena1.jpg"alt="">
            <div class="cs_text">
                <h4>solution</h4>
                <p>In a close cooperation with Helena we created unique content focused on client’s needs  which would not be found anywhere 
                    else. (In reality section - morgage timeline or 3 steps to get morgage) The results were great. It helped to simplify work
                     with clients and to build trustful relationship what was one of our main goals.</p>

                <h4>process</h4>
                <p>After a competition research and a deep analysis of Helena’s business we have agreed to build website on Helena’s many years 
                    experiences. To put together unique guidelines for clients which would be found only on her web. In design phase we came with
                     idea of beautiful illustrated Avatar to represent Helena within he overall web. Also the illustrations, icons and functional
                      interactive elements were made exclusively for this project. </p>

                    <p>I discovered listening music helps me to focus on coding. In this project I listened mix of song from Tomas Klus and Krystof.</p>
