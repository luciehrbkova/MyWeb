                <h4>brief</h4>
                <p>To create a website for an entrepreneur who had recently decided to start a business as a german lecture and interpreter. 
                The website should represent herself as well as her services and become a source to get new clients.</p>

                <h4>client</h4>
                <p>Jana Novotna is an entrepreneur offering translation services and teaching German.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>collaboration</h4>
                <p>In this project I collaborated closely with tallented designer <a href="https://www.behance.net/martinnovotny93?tracking_source=search%7Cmartin%20novotny">Martin Novotny</a>.</p>

                <h4>challenge</h4>
                <p>Our client was new in the business so firstly we had to analyze the niche market that she would like to target for optimal success.
                    Also we had to solve how to catch the attention of conservative potential customers. And generally, how to get the trust of new customers.</p>

            <div class="cs_text">
                <h4>process</h4>
                <p>At the beginning of the process we have designed a selection of different stylescapes to perfectly match the client’s taste and desired direction.
                    While creating content, we used personas to represent potential customers and create content tailored to them individually.
                    For example: A female interested in doing an au pair experience in order to get a better paid job in a different country.</p>

            <div class="cs_text">
                <h4>solution</h4>
                <p>We built a website reflecting Jana’s original approach - aiming for different target groups. We created content that attracts female au pairs, job seekers,
                 exposition exhibitors and addressed them individually in clickable sections. The final design is straightforward and modern at the same time. Special emphasis 
                 was placed on testimonials to build up confidence from new clients and to give them a clear overview of services.</p>
