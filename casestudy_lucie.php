                <p>To create a web to showcase my portfolio and list all services I am able to offer. The aim was to create 
                a playfull space user would enjoy and entertain him by UX. Good to metion I afford myself experiment with the 
                art direction I admire so much - bauhas movement contcepts.</p>

                <h4>challenge</h4>
                <p>Simplification of design to work only with esential elements in primary colours - yellow circle, blue square and red 
                    triangle and intergangable black & white color combinations.
                    <br>
                    During the development stage it was challenging to find ways how to build and technically master all interaction ideas i came with in designs.</p>

                <h4>process</h4>
                <p>I have decided for a little experiment based on my favourite bauhaus thoughts - less is more.
                    I dived deeper into my professional values analysis and tried to find their equivalent  in these basic elements: 
                    <br><br>
                    YELLOW CIRCLE = INFINITE CREATIVITY
                    <br>
                    circle has allways been a perfect infinite shape for artists and mathematics,
                    yellow is a symbol for optimism, creativity and energy
                    <br><br>
                    BLUE SQUARE = RELIABLE PROFESSIONALITY
                    <br>
                    square - “brick” basic element to build something bigger, also stability, reliability, 
                    blue - trust, professionalism, stability
                    <br><br>
                    RED TRIANGL = goal-oriantated attitude
                    <br>
                    triangle - symbol for movement, pointing, setting direction
                    red - action, confidence</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/lucie7.jpg" alt="">

                <h4>solution</h4>
                <p>The final soulution is a minimalistic design full of interactions which allows user to explore content. 
                The basic elements guide user through each sections (bricket game in services, triangle as an arrow coming form the brief 
                to the final results in each project). <br> As a big fan of black & white I have decided to preserve the decision for user to 
                play with these two themes and fully enjoy and experience the potential of both colors.</p>

                <p>I discovered listening music helps me to focus on coding. In this project I listened the czech band Mandrage, you can enjoy my favourite song here!</p>
