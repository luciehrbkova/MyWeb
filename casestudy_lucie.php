                <h4>brief</h4>
                <p>TTo create a website that showcases my portfolio and list all the services that I am able to offer. The aim was to create a playful space that 
                the user would enjoy and entertain them using UX. The Portfolio website truly reflects my admiration of the Bauhaus movement concept.</p>

                <h4>challenge</h4>
                <p>Simplification of the design to work only with essential elements in primary colors - yellow circle, blue square and red triangle and interchangeable black & white color combinations.
                    <br>
                    During the development stage it was challenging to find ways to build and technically master all the interaction ideas that I came up with during the design phase.</p>

                <h4>process</h4>
                <p>I have decided on a little experiment based on my favorite Bauhaus concept - less is more. <br>
                    I dived deeper into analyzing my professional values and tried to find their symbolism in these basic elements: 
                    <br><br><br>
                    YELLOW CIRCLE <br> = INFINITE CREATIVITY
                    <br><br>
                    The circle has always been a perfect infinite shape for artists and mathematicians. Yellow is a symbol for optimism, creativity and energy
                    <br><br><br>
                    BLUE SQUARE <br> = RELIABLE PROFESSIONALISM
                    <br><br>
                    Square - “brick” basic element to build something bigger as well as stability and reliability. <br>
                    Blue - trust, professionalism, stability.
                    <br><br><br>
                    RED TRIANGL <br>= GOAL-ORIENTATED ATTITUDE
                    <br><br>
                    Triangle is a symbol for movement, pointing, setting direction.<br>
                    Red - the color of action, confidence.</p>

                <h4>solution</h4>
                <p>The final solution is a minimalistic design full of interactions which allows the user to explore content. The basic elements guide the user through each section (bracket game in services, 
                triangle as an arrow coming form the brief to the final results in each project). <br><br> As a big fan of black & white I have decided to preserve the decision of the canvas color for 
                the user to play with these two themes and fully enjoy and experience the potential of both colors.</p>

                <p>I discovered listening to music helps me focus on coding. In this project I listened to the Czech band Mandrage, you can enjoy my favourite songs here!</p>
